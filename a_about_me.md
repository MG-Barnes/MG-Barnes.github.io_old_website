My name is Morgan Barnes and I am currently a PhD student at Rice University in the Materials Science and NanoEngineering department and am a member of the [Verduzco Polymer lab](http://verduzcolab.blogs.rice.edu/).

Polymers are ubiquitous in our lives from the toothbrushes we use, the fabrics we wear and the chairs we sit in. From their conception, isotropic polymers have played a large role in everyday household items and manufacturing for their low weight and costs. However, as technologies advanced the need for multi-functional materials that exhibit unique mechanical, electrical and optical properties has emerged which are often only available in highly anisotropic polymers. 

The focus of my research is to develop these novel multi-functional anisotropic polymers. Specifically I work with liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) to create reversibly shape-shifting soft materials and covalent organic frameworks (COFs) to make strong, tough films. Both of LCEs and COF films are promising for a variety of applications from soft-robotics and biomedical devices to ulta-light weight armor and other high-performance applications, respectively. 

In addition to my research I am also passionate about sharing my work and the research process with anyone interested. I have mentored many students and teachers in the laboratory for research projects and regularly give one-off lectures and lab tours to many different groups that visit Rice during the school year and summer. Feel free to contact me for any questions about my work specifically, or research in general!
